# Working style - mob coding

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Dzhangir, Niya
* Date: Oct 31, 2021

## Context and Problem Statement

After assigning task to each person, and each make some progress, people need a way to communicate together to solve inter-related issues

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* Often the task assigned are inter-related
* Need to reduce 'bus factor'
* Unable to know the progress from each person

## Considered Options

* Change pair pair-programming
* Mob coding session
* Individual works with meeting

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "{option 2 - mob session}", because mob session allow people to work on the same physical environment, which improve working efficiency. It also allow everyone to know each other's progress on the project

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* We fully decide on mob session after the first mob session is succesfully held. Everyone participate in the session has worked and complete a lot during the time. The progress from each people in the mob session is known well.

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* It is hard to let everyone come to the session. Some just don't have time during weekend. Thus it is hard to know their progress since we depends on mob session to communicate. It also has a risk that the group is separated into different groups, and work may be repetitive

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Change-Pair Pair-programming

Each tasks is assigned to 2-3 people, they work together to solve task. After a while, when the new task is assigned the group is deleted and new group set up with different set of people

* Good, because it allow each teammate to know each other better
* Good, because pair allow support from each other
* Bad, because the swift takes a long time. Inter-task issue may not be solved because of the poor communication

### Mob Programming Session

Tasks are assigned to 2-3 people group too, but every week people come together physically at the same space to work together.

* Good, because vibrate commucation is happening, when everyone at the same location it is very efficient
* Good, because 
* Bad, because people who can't come to the mob session may be left out

### Individual works with meeting

Each person work on one branch with meeting as the main communication way

* Good, because it doesn't need communication when people are working along. Some people are more efficient when work by themselves. Either they did it or they didnt
* Bad, because it increase bus factor rapidly
* Bad, because there is no intense communication, there is less a sense of "team" and in the end maybe one or two guys will take the entire project, which is unfair
