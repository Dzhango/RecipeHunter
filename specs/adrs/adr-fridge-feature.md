## Context and Problem Statement

We need to choose a domain specific feature to make the recipe app special to our customer

## Decision Drivers

* There are many recipe apps in the market or class, we need to stand out
* College students have special needs. Our APP should be domain specific

## Considered Options

* Grocery shopping cart with price budget
* Find recipe by ingredients (fridge)
* Meal plan by calories
* Meal plan by budget

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Find recipe by ingredients (fridge). We choose this feature because college students often make their meals depending on what is left in the fridge. They have limited time for shop and limited time to cook

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Grocery shopping cart with price budget

Each ingredints in the recipes could be added to a cart, which will presents to user the expected price of all grocery items

* Good, because users would be able to plan out their budget and know in advance whether they can afford the shopping or not
* Bad, because price fluctuate based on location. Localized prices are hard to get.

### Find recipe by ingredients (fridge)

In a fridge page, user will be prompted to enter what is in their fridge. A list of recipes will be found to match the input ingredients

* Good, because college students often make their meals depending on what is left in the fridge.
* Good, because using up all the ingredients in the fridge is also a way to save money.
* Bad, because user need to type a list of input, which could be exhausive. But considering our target users who are college students, we don't expect them to have too many ingredients in the fridge.

### Meal plan by calories

* Good, because very useful for health-conscious college students
* Bad, because calorie can be simply added in a recipe page, which should be enough for most of the health-conscious college students
* Bad, because we doubt if many of our target customers really need this feature

### Meal plan by budget

* Good, because student who live on a budget could plan our their meals accordingly
* Bad, because hard to estimate user's taste just by generating random or popular meals based on the input budget
