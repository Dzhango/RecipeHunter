# Change of UI - bootstrap refactor

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Dzhangir, Ryan, Run, 
* Date: TODO

## Context and Problem Statement

The current UI of the page is basic and grey. Aesthetical choices have not been made. Change of even very small UI components is difficult. Responsive Web design is not present. We need a better looking UI to attract user to use our functionality.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* The current UI cannot attract users to our web site
* Web page is not responsive
* Future development is difficult

## Considered Options

* Keep developing on the current UI
* Use bootstrap to refactor
* Use React to refactor

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: use bootstrap to refactor, because bootstrap is less complex to use than React. Two of our teammates already have the experience of using bootstrap, thus can handle the refactor.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Keep developing on the current UI

* Good, because no others things needs to be done
* Good, because back-end development is updated with the current UI
* Bad, because future further development is hard
* Bad, because it looks not very modern

### Use bootstrap to refactor

* Good, because the page looks more organized and modern and aesthetic choices can be made and changed easily
* Good, because bootstrap rather easy to learn and understand. It is manipulated by classes. One or two of our groupmates are familiar with bootstrap.
* Good, because it makes responsive web page possible in our time limit.
* Bad, because need to merge previous backend to this new frontend.

### Use React to refactor

* Good, because can built very interactive and aesthetically good web pages.
* Bad, because it takes long time to set up the baseline. No one in our group is very familiar with React.
