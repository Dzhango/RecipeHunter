1. We will use Slack (cse110-fa21-group6.slack.com) as the primary means of communication.
2. We expect team member to read message on a daily bases. For individual messages, one will not replied later than 12 hours after the message was sent.
3. Every week will have a fixed-time meeting that everyone should attend. Every week will also have a soft-time meeting that is scheduled on a weekly basis.
4. Team members are expected to complete daily standups. 
5. We value respectful communication. Please be considering for other's feeling.
6. If there is a conflict between any two team members that cannot be solved by them individually, an in-person/online meeting will be scheduled first, with the people involved in the conflict and one of the team leader. If such meeting can not resolve the conflict, the issue will be reported to TA or professor.
7. Everyone should complete their assigned tasks on-time. If a team member continuously blocking the workflow for consecutive two days or 3 days in a week, a short meeting for communication between the team leader and the blocker will be set up first. 
8. If a team member fails to live up to this agreement, the situation may be reported to the staff, but the team will still be responsible for submitting a completed assignment. Staff will be available to meet with teams to resolve issues.
