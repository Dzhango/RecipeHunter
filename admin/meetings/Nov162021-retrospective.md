* Slack Communication (Mad): When post a question on slack, no one answer and no one respond
  * Antonia: If someone is not attending the meeting, they should be notified (via slack/text/call according to personal preferences)
  * Dzhangir: People are busy, they may checked out for a few days, but when I looked into repo, things are getting done
  * Richard: we have team rule set for replying within 12 hours
  * React feature is helpful, so people feeling that not talking into void. Reply to the message should be under the message itself, so the screen is not over crowded with one issue/message thread.
  * People missing the meeting may be in the meeting if they get the message

  * Dzhangir: A: add minimal CSS, focus on function for now
* Overwhelmed: feeling inexperienced and overwhelmed at the size of the project [Sad]
