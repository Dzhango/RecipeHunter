   5. serving besides ingredient √ done
   6. calorie √
   7. fridge: √
      1. user input: a list of ingredients, output: a most "matching" recipe
      2. land on a page with many recipes, instead of asking input
      3. a feature you activate with a “what can i make?” button or something
   8. input calorie and type of diet, output a meal plan (spoonacular API) x
   9. grocery shopping cart with prices budget -- yet to decide
